# Stuyk <sub>(Pronounced as 'Stuck')</sub>

Currently working as a Senior Software Engineer helping build AtomOne with a focused on decentralized applications, wallets.

I sometimes [ramble about the state of the world, and myself](https://github.com/Stuyk/ramblings), give it a read if you want to know more about me.

I am often somewhere between manic and depressed but I try to use it as a strength to empower creativity.
