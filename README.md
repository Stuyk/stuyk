# Stuyk <sub>(Pronounced as 'Stuck')</sub>

Currently working as a Senior Software Engineer helping build AtomOne with a focused on decentralized applications, wallets.

I sometimes [ramble about the state of the world, and myself](https://github.com/Stuyk/ramblings), give it a read if you want to know more about me.

I am often somewhere between manic and depressed but I try to use it as a strength to empower creativity.

## Abusing GitHub

Yes, sometimes I abuse GitHub's action runners because they're great for small applications that collect data. Here's a few of them.

I'm an incredibly frugal person and sometimes I look for $0.00 solutions and see how far I can take them.

- [0xForum](https://github.com/Stuyk/0x-atomone-forum) is a small application built on top of AtomOne that enables people to post threads, and reply to threads through the blockchain.
- [CryptoPrices](https://github.com/Stuyk/crypto-prices) is a small application that abuses coinmarketcap's free tier to get hourly prices and post them as JSON data.
